# Delta Web Map RPC server

The RPC server sends events from the server to clients. It serves as a gateway that other backend servers can send messages through.

The LibDeltaSystem library has support for sending messages on the RPC server built in. Use DeltaConnection.GetRPC() to get started.

The RPC server is live at https://rpc-prod.deltamap.net/
